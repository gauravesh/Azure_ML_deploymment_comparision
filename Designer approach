Designer approach:
Azure Machine Learning Designer Studio follows a drag-and-drop approach to designing and building machine learning models. 
The drag-and-drop interface allows users to visually construct their ML workflows by selecting and connecting pre-built modules or components. 
In Azure Machine Learning Designer Studio, users can access a wide range of modules that represent different ML tasks, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. These modules can be dragged from the module palette and dropped onto the canvas. Users can then connect the modules together to define the data flow and processing sequence. By using the drag-and-drop interface, users can easily construct complex ML workflows without the need for extensive coding or programming knowledge. This approach simplifies the model development process and makes it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

Once the ML workflow is designed in the Azure Machine Learning Designer Studio using the drag-and-drop approach, users can execute the workflow, observe the intermediate results, and evaluate the performance of the model. The trained model can be saved and deployed for inference in production environments.
  The drag-and-drop approach in Azure Machine Learning Designer     Studio enhances the usability and ease of use, enabling users to quickly prototype, experiment, and iterate on their machine-learning models without the need for extensive manual coding.

[1] Selection of Dataset: Choose the dataset that you want to work with. This dataset should contain the relevant features and target variables for your ML task.[2] Cleaning Missing Values: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values. One common approach is to replace missing values with the average value of the respective feature.[3] Selecting Columns in Dataset: Choose the columns (features) from the dataset that you want to include in your ML model. This step helps in selecting the relevant input variables for training the model.[4] Splitting the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The typical split is to allocate around 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing the model's performance.[5] Selecting the Boosted Decision Tree Algorithm: In Azure Machine Learning Designer Studio, choose the specific ML algorithm you want to use. In this case, you selected the Boosted Decision Tree algorithm, which is a popular ensemble learning method for classification tasks[6] Training the Model: Train the selected model using the training dataset. This step involves feeding the input features and the corresponding target variable (in this case, the "survived" column) to the model and allowing it to learn patterns and make predictions[7] Scoring the Model: Apply the trained model to the testing dataset to obtain predictions. The model will predict the target variable (survived) based on the input features from the testing dataset.[8] Evaluating the Model: Assess the performance of the model using evaluation metrics. This step involves comparing the predicted values with the actual values from the testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or AUC can be used to evaluate the model's performance.[9] Selecting a Compute Cluster: Choose a compute cluster on Azure ML to execute the training and scoring steps. This provides the necessary computational resources for running the ML workflow.[10] Final Model in the Jobs Tab: After completing the training and evaluation steps, you can find the final trained model in the Jobs tab of Azure Machine Learning Designer Studio. This model can be further utilized for predictions or deployed in production environments.
