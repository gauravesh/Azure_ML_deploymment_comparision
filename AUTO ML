Auto ML
Azure AutoML streamlines the model deployment process, offering a quick and easy solution.With Azure AutoML, users can deploy their machine learning models swiftly, enabling efficient utilization for real-world predictions and decision-making tasks.The following were the steps involved for auto ml
[1] Select Dataset: Begin by selecting the dataset you want to work with. In this case, you chose the Titanic dataset.[2]Configure Job and Target Column: Configure the AutoML job and specify the target column you want to predict, which, in this case, is the "survived" column represented as integers.[3] Select Classification: Choose the classification task since you are predicting survival, which is a binary classification problem (survived or not survived).[4] Define Primary Metric and Block Models: Specify the primary metric to evaluate the models. In this case, you select the AUC weight, which is a commonly used metric for binary classification. Additionally, you have the option to block unwanted models from being trained to focus on the most relevant ones.[5] Validate and Test: AutoML will automatically train and validate various ML models using the configured settings. It will evaluate and compare their performance based on the primary metric, allowing you to select the best-performing model. You can also test the selected model to ensure it performs well on unseen data.[6] Deploy: Once you have selected the desired model, you can deploy it for inference and use it to make predictions on new data. Deployment options in Azure may include deploying the model as a web service or incorporating it into an existing application or workflow.

Following these steps, you can leverage AutoML to automatically explore and train multiple ML models, select the best-performing model based on the specified metric, and deploy it for real-world use. AutoML streamlines the ML model development process, making it easier and more efficient, particularly for users who may not have extensive ML expertise or time for manual model tuning.
