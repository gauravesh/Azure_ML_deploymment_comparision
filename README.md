# Azure_ML_deploymment_comparision
 we discussed three ways namely Notebooks , AutoML, and Designer to implement Azure Machine learning  models in ML Studio  and evaluated them based on both metric and nonmetric parameters.
Models used and compared in this paper 
1. Auto ML :  automates the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It simplifies model development by automatically selecting algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and handling feature engineering. 
2. Designer :  is a visual interface in Microsoft Azure that enables users to design and build end-to-end workflows for data integration, transformation, and machine learning. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating data pipelines and automating complex tasks without the need for coding.
3. Notebooks : a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows users to create and run Jupyter notebooks. It provides a collaborative environment for data exploration, analysis, and visualization, along with support for various programming languages, libraries, and frameworks.
